The **Artera Messaging API** allows health systems and their vendors to send SMS messages via an HTTP POST that displays in Artera's app inside a patient conversation. Messages appear to staff using Artera like usual appointment reminders and other automation-triggered messaging, with the ability to facilitate full conversational messaging if desired to help answer patient questions via SMS. Additionally, messages can be sent to the patient from a health systemâ€™s existing, known phone numbers, creating a unified patient messaging experience.

## Why should I use it?

The Messaging API inserts messages into conversations used by staff and patients to coordinate care on phone lines already familiar to patients, unifying touch points across the patient journey in a single thread. It allows health systems to deliver messages with high redundancy and reliability, [driving an up to 35% increase in content engagement](https://artera.io/resource/memorialcare-medical-foundation/).
